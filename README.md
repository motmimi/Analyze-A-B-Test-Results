# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
Run an A/B test and a logistic regression to help an e-commerce website decide on a design change

In this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
My project has the below 4 parts:
•	Introduction
•	Part I - Probability
•	Part II - A/B Test
•	Part III - Regression
